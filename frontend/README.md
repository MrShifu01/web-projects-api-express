# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/MrShifu01/web-projects-api-express.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```shell
   cd web-projects-api-express
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```
4. Additionally, navigate to the folder called 'frontend':
    ```shell
    cd frontend
    ```
5. Install the frontend dependencies:
    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

#### In the root folder called web-projects-api-express type 'npm start'
This runs the server at the chosen port which is 8000

#### In the frontend folder type 'npm start'
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project, so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Jason,
Thanks for the help, I think I managed to fix everythig, at least it seems so from my side, I encoded the URI parameters on the client side to help with the special characters and I didnt see the inifinite loop before, but I hope I managed to fix it. It seems it had to do with the useEffect hook not being set up properly.
Thanks,
Chris
